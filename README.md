# CleanroomText

CleanroomText is a Swift framework providing tools for working with strings and text.

CleanroomText is part of [the Cleanroom Project](https://github.com/gilt/Cleanroom) from [Gilt Tech](http://tech.gilt.com).


### Swift compatibility

**Important:** This is the `swift-4` branch. It uses **Swift 4.0** and **requires Xcode 9.0 beta** to compile.

If you need Swift 3.1 compatibility, use the [`master`](https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomText) branch, which requires Xcode 8.3.


#### Current status

### Adding CleanroomText to your project

[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

The simplest way to integrate CleanroomText is with the [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) dependency manager.

First, add this line to your [`Cartfile`](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile):

```
github "emaloney/CleanroomText" ~> 2.0.0
```

Then, use the `carthage` command to [update your dependencies](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#upgrading-frameworks).

Finally, you’ll need to [integrate CleanroomText into your project](https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomText/blob/swift-4/INTEGRATION.md) in order to use [the API](https://rawgit.com/emaloney/CleanroomText/swift-4/Documentation/API/index.html) it provides.

Once successfully integrated, just add the following statement to any Swift file where you want to use CleanroomText:

```swift
import CleanroomText
```

See [the Integration document](https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomText/blob/swift-4/INTEGRATION.md) for additional details on integrating CleanroomText into your project.

## Using CleanroomText

### Pluralizer

`Pluralizer`s are used to represent multiple *forms* of a *term* intended to be used with specific *quantities*.

Here's an example of a `Pluralizer` that represents two forms of the term "`goose`":

```swift
let gooser = Pluralizer(singular: "goose", plural: "geese")
```

By calling the `term(quantity: )` function, `gooser` can then be used to select the appropriate form of the term for a given quantity:

```swift
let oneGoose = gooser.term(quantity: 1)      // oneGoose will be "goose"
let threeGeese = gooser.term(quantity: 3)    // threeGeese will be "geese"
```

#### Quantity Replacement

You can also refer to the value passed to the `term(quantity: )` function from within the terms passed to `Pluralizer`'s constructor:

```swift
let gooser = Pluralizer(singular: "one goose", plural: "{#} geese")
```

With this type of `gooser`, the return values would be different:

```swift
let oneGoose = gooser.term(quantity: 1)      // oneGoose will be "one goose"
let threeGeese = gooser.term(quantity: 3)    // threeGeese will be "3 geese"
```

#### Zero Quantities

Normally, when specifying a quantity of zero, the `Pluralizer` uses the plural form of the term:

```swift
let noGeese = gooser.term(quantity: 0)       // noGeese will be "0 geese"
```

If needed, the zero-quantity form of the term can also be explicitly specified to the initializer:

```swift
let gooser = Pluralizer(singular: "one goose", plural: "{#} geese", none: "no geese")
```

With this type of `gooser`, the return values would be different:

```swift
let noGeese = gooser.term(quantity: 0)       // noGeese will be "no geese"
let oneGoose = gooser.term(quantity: 1)      // oneGoose will be "one goose"
let threeGeese = gooser.term(quantity: 3)    // threeGeese will be "3 geese"
```

## About

The Cleanroom Project began as an experiment to re-imagine Gilt’s iOS codebase in a legacy-free, Swift-based incarnation.

Since then, we’ve expanded the Cleanroom Project to include multi-platform support. Much of our codebase now supports tvOS in addition to iOS, and our lower-level code is usable on macOS and watchOS as well.

Cleanroom Project code serves as the foundation of Gilt on TV, our tvOS app [featured by Apple during the launch of the new Apple TV](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2015/). And as time goes on, we'll be replacing more and more of our existing Objective-C codebase with Cleanroom implementations.

In the meantime, we’ll be tracking the latest releases of Swift & Xcode, and [open-sourcing major portions of our codebase](https://github.com/gilt/Cleanroom#open-source-by-default) along the way.
